# **The break statement** in **for** and **while**

---

# **A. break in for Loops (10 examples)**

---

## **1. Stop a loop early**

```python
for i in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
```

Explanation: Loop stops when i becomes 3.

---

## **2. Stop when a specific item is found**

```python
for ch in "Python":
    if ch == "h":
        break
    print(ch)
```

Explanation: Loop stops at the letter h.

---

## **3. Stop when a negative number appears**

```python
for n in [5, 4, 3, -1, 2]:
    if n < 0:
        break
    print(n)
```

Explanation: Stops at the first negative.

---

## **4. Stop when a vowel is found**

```python
for ch in "sky":
    if ch in "aeiou":
        break
    print(ch)
```

Explanation: No vowels found, so full loop runs.

---

## **5. Stop when a condition becomes true**

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i > 5:
        break
    print(i)
```

Explanation: Prints 0 to 5.

---

## **6. Stop after reading first match**

```python
names = ["Tom", "Sam", "Bob"]
for name in names:
    if name == "Sam":
        break
    print(name)
```

Explanation: Loop stops when name is Sam.

---

## **7. Stop when target number appears**

```python
for n in [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]:
    if n == 16:
        break
    print(n)
```

Explanation: Stops at 16.

---

## **8. Stop inside nested loop**

```python
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(5):
        if j == 2:
            break
        print(i, j)
```

Explanation: Break stops only the inner loop.

---

## **9. Stop before a specific word**

```python
for word in ["start", "run", "stop", "end"]:
    if word == "stop":
        break
    print(word)
```

Explanation: Stops at "stop".

---

## **10. Break after finding first even number**

```python
for n in [1, 3, 5, 8, 9]:
    if n % 2 == 0:
        break
    print(n)
```

Explanation: Stops when 8 appears.

---

# **B. break in while Loops (10 examples)**

---

## **11. Basic break in while**

```python
i = 0
while i < 10:
    if i == 4:
        break
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

Explanation: Stops when i reaches 4.

---

## **12. Using break in an infinite loop**

```python
i = 1
while True:
    if i > 3:
        break
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

Explanation: break makes the infinite loop stop.

---

## **13. Stop when user enters stop**

```python
ans = ""
while True:
    ans = input("Type stop: ")
    if ans == "stop":
        break
```

Explanation: Loop ends when user types “stop”.

---

## **14. Stop when number becomes negative**

```python
n = 5
while True:
    if n < 0:
        break
    print(n)
    n -= 1
```

Explanation: Stops when n becomes negative.

---

## **15. Stop when even number appears**

```python
n = 1
while n <= 10:
    if n % 2 == 0:
        break
    print(n)
    n += 1
```

Explanation: Loop stops at first even number, which is 2.

---

## **16. Stop when condition fails in loop**

```python
i = 10
while i > 0:
    if i == 7:
        break
    print(i)
    i -= 1
```

Explanation: Ends early at 7.

---

## **17. Stop inside nested while**

```python
i = 0
while i < 3:
    j = 0
    while j < 5:
        if j == 3:
            break
        print(i, j)
        j += 1
    i += 1
```

Explanation: Inner loop stops at j = 3.

---

## **18. Stop when sum exceeds limit**

```python
total = 0
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    total += i
    if total > 15:
        break
    print(total)
    i += 1
```

Explanation: Stops when total becomes more than 15.

---

## **19. Stop when input is empty**

```python
text = "start"
while True:
    text = input("Enter text (empty to stop): ")
    if text == "":
        break
```

Explanation: Break ends the loop when user enters nothing.

---

## **20. Stop after repeating 5 times**

```python
count = 1
while True:
    print("Attempt", count)
    if count == 5:
        break
    count += 1
```

Explanation: Stops exactly at attempt 5.
