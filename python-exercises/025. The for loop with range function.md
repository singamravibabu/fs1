# **The for statement with the range() function**

---

## **1. Loop from 0 to 4**

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

Explanation: `range(5)` gives 0,1,2,3,4.

---

## **2. Loop from 1 to 5**

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

Explanation: Starts at 1, ends before 6.

---

## **3. Loop with steps of 2**

```python
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)
```

Explanation: Step size 2 → 0,2,4,6,8.

---

## **4. Loop backwards**

```python
for i in range(5, 0, -1):
    print(i)
```

Explanation: Counts down → 5,4,3,2,1.

---

## **5. Loop negative values**

```python
for i in range(-3, 4):
    print(i)
```

Explanation: Prints from -3 to +3.

---

## **6. Loop backward with step -2**

```python
for i in range(10, 0, -2):
    print(i)
```

Explanation: 10,8,6,4,2.

---

## **7. Loop using a variable in range()**

```python
n = 4
for i in range(n):
    print(i)
```

Explanation: Uses variable `n` as limit.

---

## **8. Loop and print squares**

```python
for i in range(6):
    print(i * i)
```

Explanation: Prints squares of 0–5.

---

## **9. Loop and print even numbers**

```python
for i in range(2, 21, 2):
    print(i)
```

Explanation: Steps of 2 give even numbers.

---

## **10. Loop and print odd numbers**

```python
for i in range(1, 20, 2):
    print(i)
```

Explanation: Steps of 2 from 1 give odd numbers.

---

## **11. Loop fixed number of times**

```python
for _ in range(3):
    print("Hello")
```

Explanation: Underscore used when loop variable is not needed.

---

## **12. Loop through digits in reverse**

```python
for i in range(9, -1, -1):
    print(i)
```

Explanation: Includes 9 down to 0.

---

## **13. Loop using range inside math**

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i * 10)
```

Explanation: Prints 10,20,30,40,50.

---

## **14. Loop and check even/odd**

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i, "even")
    else:
        print(i, "odd")
```

Explanation: Uses conditional logic inside loop.

---

## **15. Loop and build a list**

```python
numbers = []
for i in range(5):
    numbers.append(i)
print(numbers)
```

Explanation: Creates list [0,1,2,3,4].

---

## **16. Nested loops using range**

```python
for i in range(2):
    for j in range(3):
        print(i, j)
```

Explanation: Two loops → prints pairs.

---

## **17. Loop with large step**

```python
for i in range(0, 50, 10):
    print(i)
```

Explanation: Steps of 10.

---

## **18. Infinite-looking countdown (but controlled)**

```python
for i in range(100, 0, -20):
    print(i)
```

Explanation: Countdown by 20.

---

## **19. Loop using range to iterate through indices**

```python
names = ["A", "B", "C"]
for i in range(len(names)):
    print(i, names[i])
```

Explanation: Uses index positions.

---

## **20. Loop over range to repeat a pattern**

```python
for i in range(5):
    print("*" * (i + 1))
```

Explanation: Prints a triangle pattern.
