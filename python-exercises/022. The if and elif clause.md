# **The if–elif statement**

---

## 1. Basic if–elif structure

```python
if 5 > 10:
    print("Five is bigger")
elif 10 > 5:
    print("Ten is bigger")
```

Explanation: First condition is false; second is true.

---

## 2. Check two different numbers

```python
if 3 == 4:
    print("Equal")
elif 3 < 4:
    print("3 is smaller")
```

Explanation: First false, second true.

---

## 3. Using strings

```python
if "apple" == "orange":
    print("Same")
elif "apple" < "orange":
    print("Alphabetically smaller")
```

Explanation: apple comes before orange.

---

## 4. Checking membership

```python
if "z" in "apple":
    print("Found z")
elif "a" in "apple":
    print("Found a")
```

Explanation: First false, second true.

---

## 5. Checking list membership

```python
if 10 in [1, 2, 3]:
    print("10 is in the list")
elif 3 in [1, 2, 3]:
    print("3 is in the list")
```

Explanation: First false, second true.

---

## 6. Boolean conditions

```python
if False:
    print("This won't run")
elif True:
    print("This will run")
```

Explanation: True triggers the elif.

---

## 7. Math expression in conditions

```python
if (2 + 2) == 5:
    print("Wrong math")
elif (2 + 2) == 4:
    print("Correct math")
```

Explanation: Second condition is true.

---

## 8. Checking float values

```python
if 3.14 > 4.0:
    print("3.14 is bigger")
elif 3.14 < 4.0:
    print("3.14 is smaller")
```

Explanation: Second condition is true.

---

## 9. Using and operator

```python
if (10 > 15) and (5 > 2):
    print("Both true")
elif (10 > 5) and (2 < 3):
    print("Second condition true")
```

Explanation: First false, second true.

---

## 10. Using or operator

```python
if (1 == 2) or (2 == 3):
    print("Any true")
elif (3 == 3) or (4 == 5):
    print("At least one true here")
```

Explanation: Second condition true.

---

## 11. Using not operator

```python
if not (5 < 3):
    print("Not running")
elif not (3 < 1):
    print("False becomes True")
```

Explanation: First condition true, so elif won't run.

---

## 12. If–elif with variables

```python
a = 10
b = 20

if a > b:
    print("a is bigger")
elif a < b:
    print("a is smaller")
```

Explanation: a < b, so elif runs.

---

## 13. Comparing lengths of strings

```python
if len("abc") == len("hello"):
    print("Same length")
elif len("abc") < len("hello"):
    print("abc is shorter")
```

Explanation: abc is shorter.

---

## 14. Using chained comparison

```python
if 5 < 3:
    print("First")
elif 3 < 5 < 10:
    print("Second is true")
```

Explanation: Second condition is true.

---

## 15. Checking types

```python
if type(5) == float:
    print("Float")
elif type(5) == int:
    print("Integer")
```

Explanation: int condition is true.

---

## 16. Negative number check

```python
if -2 > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif -2 < 0:
    print("Negative number")
```

Explanation: Second condition is true.

---

## 17. Character comparison

```python
if "b" < "a":
    print("b comes first")
elif "a" < "b":
    print("a comes first")
```

Explanation: a comes first alphabetically.

---

## 18. Mathematical decision

```python
if 10 % 3 == 0:
    print("Divisible by 3")
elif 10 % 2 == 0:
    print("Divisible by 2")
```

Explanation: 10 % 3 is not 0, but 10 % 2 is 0.

---

## 19. Float comparison again

```python
if 1.99 >= 2.0:
    print("Bigger")
elif 1.99 < 2.0:
    print("Smaller")
```

Explanation: 1.99 < 2.0 is true.

---

## 20. Multiple elif checks

```python
if 100 < 50:
    print("Less")
elif 100 == 50:
    print("Equal")
elif 100 > 50:
    print("Greater")
```

Explanation: Third condition is true.
