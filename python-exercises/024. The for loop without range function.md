# **The for statement in Python without using the range() function**

---

## 1. Loop through a list of numbers

```python
for n in [1, 2, 3, 4]:
    print(n)
```

Explanation: The loop goes through each element of the list.

---

## 2. Loop through a list of strings

```python
for word in ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]:
    print(word)
```

Explanation: Each fruit name prints once.

---

## 3. Loop through characters in a string

```python
for ch in "Python":
    print(ch)
```

Explanation: The loop prints each character of the string.

---

## 4. Loop through a tuple

```python
for item in (10, 20, 30):
    print(item)
```

Explanation: Tuples can also be iterated like lists.

---

## 5. Loop through a set

```python
for item in {1, 2, 3}:
    print(item)
```

Explanation: Set order is not guaranteed.

---

## 6. Loop through dictionary keys

```python
for key in {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}:
    print(key)
```

Explanation: Looping over a dictionary goes through keys.

---

## 7. Loop through dictionary values

```python
for value in {"a": 1, "b": 2}.values():
    print(value)
```

Explanation: values() returns all values in the dictionary.

---

## 8. Loop through dictionary items (key-value pairs)

```python
for k, v in {"x": 10, "y": 20}.items():
    print(k, v)
```

Explanation: Each pair of key and value is unpacked.

---

## 9. Loop through a list of mixed data types

```python
for item in [1, "A", 3.14, True]:
    print(item)
```

Explanation: Lists can hold different types.

---

## 10. Loop through words in a sentence

```python
for word in "Python is fun".split():
    print(word)
```

Explanation: split() turns the string into a list of words.

---

## 11. Loop through nested lists

```python
for row in [[1, 2], [3, 4]]:
    print(row)
```

Explanation: Each inner list acts as one element.

---

## 12. Loop through nested lists (inner values)

```python
for row in [[1, 2], [3, 4]]:
    for col in row:
        print(col)
```

Explanation: Two loops let you access each number.

---

## 13. Loop through a string and check vowels

```python
for ch in "education":
    if ch in "aeiou":
        print(ch)
```

Explanation: Prints only the vowels.

---

## 14. Loop through a list and use conditions

```python
for n in [5, 10, 15, 20]:
    if n > 10:
        print("Greater:", n)
```

Explanation: Only values greater than 10 are printed.

---

## 15. Loop through a list using enumeration

```python
for index, value in enumerate(["A", "B", "C"]):
    print(index, value)
```

Explanation: enumerate() gives both index and item.

---

## 16. Loop through a list of tuples

```python
for a, b in [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]:
    print(a, b)
```

Explanation: Each tuple is unpacked automatically.

---

## 17. Loop through characters and stop at a condition

```python
for ch in "Python":
    if ch == "h":
        break
    print(ch)
```

Explanation: Loop stops when it reaches "h".

---

## 18. Loop through characters and skip one

```python
for ch in "Python":
    if ch == "h":
        continue
    print(ch)
```

Explanation: “h” is skipped.

---

## 19. Loop through a list and build another list

```python
new_list = []
for n in [1, 2, 3]:
    new_list.append(n * 2)
print(new_list)
```

Explanation: Doubles each number and stores it.

---

## 20. Loop through a dictionary keys sorted (no range used)

```python
for key in sorted({"b": 2, "a": 1, "c": 3}):
    print(key)
```

Explanation: sorted() returns keys in alphabetical order.
