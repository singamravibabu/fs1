# **The while statement**

---

## **1. Basic while loop**

```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

Explanation: Runs while `i` is less than 5.

---

## **2. Countdown using while**

```python
n = 5
while n > 0:
    print(n)
    n -= 1
```

Explanation: Counts down from 5 to 1.

---

## **3. Loop stops when condition becomes False**

```python
x = 3
while x != 0:
    print("Running")
    x -= 1
```

Explanation: Stops when x becomes 0.

---

## **4. While loop with break**

```python
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

Explanation: Stops early when i equals 5.

---

## **5. While loop with continue**

```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    i += 1
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
```

Explanation: Skips printing number 3.

---

## **6. Using while to sum numbers**

```python
i = 1
total = 0
while i <= 5:
    total += i
    i += 1
print(total)
```

Explanation: Adds numbers 1 to 5.

---

## **7. While loop for even numbers**

```python
i = 0
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i += 2
```

Explanation: Steps of 2 print even numbers.

---

## **8. While loop for odd numbers**

```python
i = 1
while i < 10:
    print(i)
    i += 2
```

Explanation: Prints odd numbers.

---

## **9. While loop printing characters of a string**

```python
text = "Python"
i = 0
while i < len(text):
    print(text[i])
    i += 1
```

Explanation: Prints each character.

---

## **10. While loop with a boolean condition**

```python
running = True
while running:
    print("Looping")
    running = False
```

Explanation: Runs only once because flag becomes False.

---

## **11. While loop generating a multiplication table**

```python
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print("2 x", i, "=", 2 * i)
    i += 1
```

Explanation: Prints the 2-times table.

---

## **12. While loop with multiple conditions**

```python
i = 1
while i < 10 and i != 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

Explanation: Stops when i reaches 5.

---

## **13. While loop controlling list index**

```python
lst = [10, 20, 30]
i = 0
while i < len(lst):
    print(lst[i])
    i += 1
```

Explanation: Iterates through the list using index.

---

## **14. While loop to reverse a countdown**

```python
n = 3
while n >= 0:
    print(n)
    n -= 1
```

Explanation: Counts down to 0.

---

## **15. While loop creating a pattern**

```python
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print("*" * i)
    i += 1
```

Explanation: Prints a triangle pattern.

---

## **16. While loop waiting for a specific value**

```python
value = 0
while value < 7:
    print("Waiting...")
    value += 3
```

Explanation: Loop runs until value reaches 7 or more.

---

## **17. While loop using break for safety**

```python
i = 0
while True:
    if i == 4:
        break
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

Explanation: Infinite loop controlled by break.

---

## **18. While loop using continue to skip values**

```python
i = 0
while i < 6:
    i += 1
    if i == 4:
        continue
    print(i)
```

Explanation: Skips number 4.

---

## **19. While loop repeating until user input condition**

```python
ans = ""
while ans != "stop":
    ans = input("Type 'stop' to end: ")
```

Explanation: Loop ends when user types stop.

---

## **20. While loop with decreasing step**

```python
i = 20
while i >= 0:
    print(i)
    i -= 5
```

Explanation: Steps of -5 → 20, 15, 10, 5, 0.
